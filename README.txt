This small web-application is an exercise in using my workflow app. It was
written very quickly (in under 2 days) because I had a deadline: I wanted to
have it "finished" so I could demonstrate it to someone. As a result, important
stuff like unit tests are missing. I'll add those in the coming days (although
there are stubs for them).

Please note: this is a toy "demo" project and *not* for serious use. Any
feedback please contact me (see URL at the top of this file).
